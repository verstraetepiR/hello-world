Good bye world

Dennis Henry Hennelly directed this film

we are not talking about usual suspects

JDB: In Atom I do not see the learnings RRG had
Specifically, lines 12 through 21:
-What I (RRG) have learnt
from the forked version I could fetch and modify the master version and then push it

I could fetch, and modifiy the new feature version of Jonas, but I could not not push (Autentificaiton issue)

question: the difference is because I am accessing the the master and an upstream version??

Then I also could close the version directly with the desktop version

And it seems that I can not push any committed change in teh

I will now try to push this to RRG_branch and see if it works
